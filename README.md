# PyECM

## Description
The Electronic Chirality Measure (ECM) is a quantity that measures the chirality of any (chiral) molecular system. It was proposed by Luca Bellarosa and Francesco Zerbetto in 2003 [[1]](#1). In 2023 [[2]](#2), J. J. Aucar, A. Stroppa, and G. A. Aucar showed a novel, strong, and positive correlation between the energy difference of the total electronic energies of two enantiomers and ECM, supporting a subtle interplay between the weak forces acting within the nuclei of a given molecule and its chirality.

The Electronic Chirality Measure (ECM) is an end-to-end package implemented in Python 3.9 to measure the mentioned quantity. It also has some development interface with the [PySCF](https://pyscf.org/) and [DIRAC](https://www.diracprogram.org) packages.

The ecm package uses simple input files in xyz format. The so-called nearest asymmetric structure is also needed. It can be easily obtained from [this website](https://csm.ouproj.org.il/molecule). The package also allows the user to perform some simple plots to have a better understanding of the geometry of the systems under study.

The ECM is calculated computing the electronic wave function using a standard and powerful quantum chemistry package such as [PySCF](https://pyscf.org/), the Python-based Simulations of Chemistry Framework. PySCF is an efficient platform for quantum chemistry calculations that can be used to simulate the properties of molecules and crystals using mean-field and post-mean-field methods [[3]](#3).

The ecm main purpose is to be a user-friendly package, easy to install, import, and run, available on most platforms and open-source. As a Python module, ecm can be integrated into any workflow. This package has code reviews with unit testing and continuous integration, code coverage tools, and automatically keeps documentation up–to–date.

The basic [example](docs/source/quickstart.rst) demonstrates some of these features.

This package allows to:

   1. Perform basic plots in order to analyze the systems under study.
   2. Import and export molecules from/to xyz and DIRAC format.
   3. Calculate CCM and ECM in a single structure.
   4. Calculate CCM and ECM in several structures at once and in the virtual mirroring path of each one.

## Requirements
First, you should install the required python packages. They can be found in the file `requirements.txt`. Developers should install `requirements_dev.txt`.

## Installation
pyECM is a **Python 3.9** package

1. Download this Git Repository

2. It is recommended to install a virtual environment:

    ```python -m venv venv_pyecm```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

    ```source venv_pyecm/bin/activate```

<!-- Install the packages through "pip install pyECM". Setup.py should be configured. -->
4. Install dependencies:

    ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

5. Run pyECM (check some examples below)

<br/><br/>

For developers,

1. Install dependencies:

      ```pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements_dev.txt```

2. Run all test:

      ``tox==3.24.3``

      ``tox``


<br/><br/>
To create local html pages,

1. Get into "docs" folder

2. Create html pages

      ```make html```

## Usage
A detailed workflow is provided in the `workflow` directory. It has a list of Jupyter notebooks with detailed examples about pyECM tools and capabilities.

1. Getting started with some basic plots.
      - `01.Plots.ipynb` 
2. Calculation of ECM in a simple molecule. 
      - `02.ECM_one-molecule.ipynb` 
3. Calculation of ECM in several molecules. 
      - `04.ECM_several-molecules.ipynb` 

## Roadmap
Some of the ideas to keep growing are:

* Obtain the nearest achiral structure within the code.
